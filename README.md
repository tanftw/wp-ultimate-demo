# WP Ultimate Demo
WP Ultimate Demo is a WordPress plugin to create demo website which allows users test your products in both front end and back end 
and automatically cleanup demo data in the routine which you setup. 

We believe that powerful should also means simple. In WP Ultimate Demo, you won't find any complicated UI, everything just work as it should be.
All you need is "Activate" plugin and turn on demo mode whenever you need.
